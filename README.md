# Gretchen
Gimbal Robot

A project I did at a robotics program at SNU in Seoul, Korea. 
I built a 3D-printed 2DOF gimbal robot named "Gretchen" during a humanoid robotics course at Seoul National University. I used gretchen to identify and track balls in space, live detect over 50 types of objects using YOLOv3, and recognize 5 different classes of surgical instruments based on personal data annotation and model training using YOLO.
